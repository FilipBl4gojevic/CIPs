## Simple Summary

Royalties are an important part of the Cardano NFT ecosystem and its sustainability. They are one of the main ways to continuously fund project creators, authors and artists through sales on the secondary market and, if implemented correctly, remove the need for outside funding. This CIP proposes an update to CIP 27 which has not really been adopted by the community. The aim is to have a simple, easy to use standard that supports distributing royalties to multiple addresses and updateable royalties.

## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Cardano protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during the discussion.

  

## Backward Compatibility

All CIPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The GIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. GIP submissions without a sufficient backward compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases

Test cases for implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementations

The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status “Active”, but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of “rough consensus and running code” is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
